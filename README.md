# Implementation
The starter files for the game was provided by udacity which includes index.html, app.js, engine.js and resources.js together with an image folder.

In the files, which we cloned from their github, they already taken care of the game engine which draws the canvas on the page and the image loading helper that ensures the images for the game are loaded, cached, and ready for the game.

All I did is to ready the comments in the files and then write out my code accordingly.
